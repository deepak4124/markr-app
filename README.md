# Markr - Markdown Notes App with Pomodoro Timer 

Markr is a simple Markdown Notes app bundled with a Pomodoro Timer, built to explore **Electron.js** and how it bridges web tech with desktop applications.

## Why Electron.js?

I built this project to dive into **Electron.js** and understand how it allows web apps to run as native desktop applications. With Electron, you can use familiar technologies like **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript** to create cross-platform desktop apps. This project helped me grasp how Electron manages the main and renderer processes, and how to integrate front-end frameworks like **Next.js** into an Electron shell.

## App Overview

Markr combines:

-  A **Markdown Editor** to take and preview notes.
-  A **Pomodoro Timer** to stay focused.
-  A clean and simple UI for productivity.
